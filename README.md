**Introduction**

Mitochondria carry their own genetic material that encodes a variable set of genes that are limited in number but functionally important. Aside from orthology, the lineage-specific order and orientation of these genes are also relevant. Here, we develop a database, PMGD(Plant Mitochondrial Genome Databases), which focuses on organizational variability of mitochondrial genes and genomes from diverse taxonomic groups.
